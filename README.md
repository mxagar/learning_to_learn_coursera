The course presents methods for learning based on the latest neuroscience research insights.

Overview:
1. Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

## 1. Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

Two modes of thinking ar distinguised:
- Focused thinking: it is related to solving problems we know or whic are similar to scenarios we are familiar with
- Diffuse thinking: related to solving problems we are not familiar with

Some notes:
- If we are in one mode, we cannot benefit from the other
- In focused mode, we directly access our brain part related to the solving
- In the diffuse mode, we more slowly need to explore pathways and need more space between neural networks/pathways
- Analogies and metaphores provide powerful techniques for learning.
- We should learn a little bit every day and relax for maximum effectiveness.
- Similarly, it is helpful to wander/alternate from focused to diffuse modes and back. Dali and Edison used to leverage that: Dali used to sit on a chair with a key in his hand and wait to falling asleep; in that moment, the key used to drop and he used to wake up, so he would focus on the thoughts that appeared in a diffuse sleepy mode.

### 1.1 What Is Learning?

Most complex functions are unconscious: vision, hearing, understanding.

Our brain has one **million billion** synapses, each of about 10 microns. They appear and disappear constantly, for instance after **learning and/or sleeping**. A not well undertood question in this regard is *how is the memory preserved?*.

Another interesting research topic is the [Default Mode Network (DMN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network): this large network activates when a person is awake but not fosuces on the outside world, such as ini a state of daydreaming.

## 2. Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

We procrastinate because our brain wants to spare us from unpleasant experiences: we see something we don't like and our attention goes to something we are better at, which causes us to be happier.

The pomodoro technique works agains procrastination: 25 minutues of focus followed by a reward during 5 minutes.

Math and science topics are the most abstract ones, that's the reason they're often the most difficult to learn.

Repeating a type or class of problems during time, with relaxation periods in between is the best way to master a topic.
Our brain goes from focus mode to difuse mode; during difuse mode, experiences are organized, neural patterns are strengthended.

### We have two main types of memories

- Working memory: small and bad memory used during current activities; it is bad because we cannot store many information for long periods, since it dissipates. That's why we need to repeat telephone numbers until we write them down. It is believed that it consists of 4 chunks of information. It is located manily in the prefontal cortex, although it is connected to the rest of the brain
- Long-term memory: very large storage of information. It is not as fast, but it is immense. It is so large that we sometimes cannot find information stored in it. The more we repeat the patterns in it (ie., recall things), the better they are stored and accessible.

The best way to store information in the long-term memory is to separate the learning in the time: several times a week.

### Sleep is fundamental for learning

- It is not a waste of time, because during sleep the toxins in our brain generated in our awake hours are eliminated
- During sleep unimportant neaural patterns are erased and the important ones strengthened
- If we practice something before sleep, chances of dreaming with it are higher, which helps solving any related difficult problems

### Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

- Active learning (doing) is much more powerful than passive one
- If your're in a boring lecture, make questions!
- Go jogging or do unrelated activities to enter and leverage the difuse mode; often the problem is remembering those thoughts
- Multi-tasking is context switching very fast; some people are better than other doing that
- Neurogenesis happens in the adulthood, in the hippocampus; the most important factors for the neurogenesis are
    - A rich and stimulating environment
    - Physical exercise: that is crucial for education!
- Surrounding yourself with creative people boosts creativity
- Try to look at things with different eyes to learn new stuff!

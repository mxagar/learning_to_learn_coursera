The course presents methods for learning based on the latest neuroscience research insights.

Overview:
1. Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

## 1. Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

Two modes of thinking ar distinguised:
- Focused thinking: it is related to solving problems we know or whic are similar to scenarios we are familiar with
- Diffuse thinking: related to solving problems we are not familiar with

Some notes:
- If we are in one mode, we cannot benefit from the other
- In focused mode, we directly access our brain part related to the solving
- In the diffuse mode, we more slowly need to explore pathways and need more space between neural networks/pathways
- Analogies and metaphores provide powerful techniques for learning.
- We should learn a little bit every day and relax for maximum effectiveness.
- Similarly, it is helpful to wander/alternate from focused to diffuse modes and back. Dali and Edison used to leverage that: Dali used to sit on a chair with a key in his hand and wait to falling asleep; in that moment, the key used to drop and he used to wake up, so he would focus on the thoughts that appeared in a diffuse sleepy mode.

### 1.1 What Is Learning?

Most complex functions are unconscious: vision, hearing, understanding.

Our brain has one **million billion** synapses, each of about 10 microns. They appear and disappear constantly, for instance after **learning and/or sleeping**. A not well undertood question in this regard is *how is the memory preserved?*.

Another interesting research topic is the [Default Mode Network (DMN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network): this large network activates when a person is awake but not fosuces on the outside world, such as ini a state of daydreaming.
